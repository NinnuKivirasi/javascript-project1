Self-Reflection

Working on this project helped me practice how user experience and technical implementation are connected. I wanted to build an application that supports users who wish to track their daily habits and see how those habits may affect chronic conditions or pain levels.
During the project, I learned more about how to create form validations, dynamic fields, conditions, and error messages. It was interesting to realize how much the clarity of error messages and real-time reactions of fields influence the overall user experience. I also learned how to use the debounce function to prevent saving too frequently, and how to add a loading animation to make the interaction feel smoother.
The biggest challenge was keeping the code clean and organized while continuously adding new features and functionality. I tried to approach the design from the user’s point of view so that the application would meet their likely expectations.
In the future, I would like to expand the application by adding charts that visually show the relationship between pain levels and sleep quality. I would also like to explore how the app could use a real database and support multiple users. Data collection and analysis are essential for this kind of tracker, so connecting to a real database would be a logical next step. In the long run, the app could even detect patterns and correlations automatically.
